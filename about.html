      <h1>Our Story by the Sea</h1>

        Aurelia was created as a quiet island hideaway where warm, genuine service
        meets the easy rhythm of the ocean.

        <p class="about-intro-text">
          Tucked along the shores of Siquijor, Aurelia Haven is a family-run
          sanctuary designed for travelers who crave peace, sun, and a touch of seaside
          wonder. Every path, palm tree, and cozy corner has been thoughtfully shaped to
          help you unwind, reconnect, and simply breathe.

          <h2>From Quiet Shoreline to Coastal Retreat</h2>
          <p>
            Aurelia began as a simple dream: a small slice of coastline where guests
            could step away from crowded cities and feel the island’s slower, softer pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, that dream has grown into a boutique resort filled with
            intimate spaces — oceanfront rooms, shaded walkways, and starlit decks —
            all inspired by the natural beauty of Siquijor and the warmth of Filipino
            hospitality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team is made up of locals who know the island by heart. They’ll happily
            share their favorite snorkeling spots, sunset views, and stories that bring
            the island’s character to life.
